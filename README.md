Hello, and welcome to the weekskip version of LifeGen!

This mod re-programs LifeGen to timeskip by weeks instead of moons and has adjusted all in-game time intervals accordingly to allow for a slower-paced gameplay. Ever been frustrated that it takes only 12 clicks for your little baby main character to grow into a fully fledged adult? Worry no longer!

This currently runs on LifeGen version 0.7.0. Do not attempt to use the self-updater if you are given the option; this is highly likely to break the game.
